# Sporky
### This is a container for all of my custom work (to keep it easily organized for me) 
#### Does not contain skins.  These are in the models/skins/sporky folder and handled by their own include.

Descriptions:
* bayside: Buildings and custom assets specifically in Bayside (city hall, for example)
* bridge: Custom assets for the 'Mercer Bridge'
* eq: Buildings and custom assets specifically in El Quebrados (e.g. hospital)
* traffic: Custom road signs, etc. that aren't specific to the bridge
* world: Replacements for actual gta-sa world objects (like land masses that needed to be edited for the bridge)

## Don't add or changing anything here.  It's just the way I like it <3
